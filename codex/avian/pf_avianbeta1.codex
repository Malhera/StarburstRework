  	"Florans live in trees
Hylotl swim the seas
But we are the Avians
And the air is where we'll be!

Our wings they work no more
But in our ships we soar
And if the Avosians come aboard
We'll toss them to the floor!",

"We'll sail across the skies
Shoot down our elders' lies
Cos when you face the Grounded
We will take you by surprise!

Our ships don't make a sound
Our feet don't touch the ground
We'll fly our boats right into the aether
Showing their god who's really better!"
