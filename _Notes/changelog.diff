--- ENVIRONMENTAL SURVIVAL UPDATE ---

--- NEW ADDTIONS
+ Status Effect Overhaul!: As a major quality of life addition, all visible status effects have been given a new coat of paint. Making them more readable on what they do and what from.
---Changes
+ Status effects now have descriptions on the ends of their titles describing their properties.
+ Changed some status effect names to better suit their strength, source, and giving them more flavor.
+ New icons for some of the status effects.
+ All debuffs are now labelled in red and any mixed effects are labelled in yellow.
+ All augment buffs are now visible on the status bar for better clarity.


+ Overhauled Fluid Status Effects!: To add some spice to the environments and how you interact with them, now fluids can haave more in-depth effects on how you interact with the world.
---Changes
+ Wet: Now reduces fire damage but increases incoming electric damage. Gives you immunity to Mild Heat, though also drains energy on Deadly Cold planets.
+ Tarred: Now reduces electric damage but increases incoming fire damage. Still reduces movement speed, albeit to a lesser extent.
---New Effect
+ Swamped, given by Swamp Water: Reduces movement speed, as well as reducing ice damage but increasing incoming poison damage.
+ Damp, given by Rain: Same effects as wet, except reduced in strength, also doesn't give you any of the environmental effects or any of the combo effects.


+ Environmental Combo Effects!: To add a little more depth to the element system and making them more attuned to the environment, I've added new effects when combined with fluid effects.
---New Status effects
+ Burning Oil (Burning + Tarred): Deals even more fire damage and can no longer be put out by fluids. Incoming ice attacks do massive damage now.
+ Frostbite (Frosted + Wet): Slows the enemy even more and reduces the afflicted's defense against all elements. Incoming fire attacks do even more damage.
+ Static Discharge (Electrified + Wet): Sends out more tesla bolts than before, which can now electrify enemies as well. Also deals damage over time to the afflicted.
+ Septic Shock (Poisoned + Swamped): Does even more poison damage and reduces the attack power of the afflicted.


+ Fluid Flasks!: To help with using these new combos, I've added flasks. With 10 units of fluid and a bottle in your hand crafting menu, you can make throwable flasks that give enemies fluid statuses to use in conjunction with your weapons.
