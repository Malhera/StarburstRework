----Ideas----

-De-homogenize every planet type with matching biomes and dungeons.

-Make new dungeons for all 7 races, maybe 1 each right now.
	*Volcanic needs new dungeons, include non-flammable buildings.

-Limit microdungeons on every planet?

-Ocean minibiomes?
	*Aquatic Versions of existing minibiomes.

-Make land versions of ocean biomes?

-Give oceans landmasses via biomes?
	*Need to test.

-Implement more underground biomes?
	*Every planet needs at least 6, 4 for the ocean planets.
	*Use one 5 times max, out of 15 planets, I'd need to make 6 underground biomes to break even.

-New ship encounters?

-More encounter dungeons.


---Potential Ideas---

-Biome Specific Weapons/Materials


----Probably Not----

-Make instanceworlds that represent every race.

-More pengiun stuff.

-Overhaul the outpost into a living city. (Maybe Later, patches would be rediculous.)
